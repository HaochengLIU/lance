Creating text dataset for LLM training using Lance in Rust
----------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we will demonstrate how to achieve the Python LLM dataset creation shown in :doc:`../Python/llm_dataset_creation` in Rust.

This example will show how to:

1. Download and process a text dataset in parts
2. Tokenize the text data 
3. Save it as a Lance dataset

The implementation details in Rust will follow similar concepts as the Python version, but with Rust-specific APIs and patterns which are significantly more verbose.
